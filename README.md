- 👋 Hi, I’m @TikTokTeKev
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about Shopify development and how this whole CLI thing works along with Ruby etc. Grasping the whole .liquid and .js structure which is a bit different to the standard html/css/php/js bootstrap templates I first started learning to code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning - haha woops, should probably have read this Q b4 answering 2. But yeah, learning liquid, js and all the dev skills I probably dont even know I need yet involved with Shopify dev.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not sure if collaborate is quite good for anyone just yet but help and guidance as to what I should be learning and developing first would be great.
